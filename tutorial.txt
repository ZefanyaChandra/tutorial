There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so
There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy
Brevity is the soul of
Listen to many, speak to a few
One may smile, and smile, and be a villain

What a piece of work is a man! How noble in
reason, how infinite in faculty! In form and moving
how express and admirable! In action how like an Angel!
in apprehension how like a god! The beauty of the
world! The paragon of animals! And yet to me, what is
this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no,
nor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seem
to say so..
